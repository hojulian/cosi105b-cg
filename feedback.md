#### Cosi105 Spring 2015 Feedack from students
* On home works
* More detailed feedback
* post “answers” to homework assignments
* More in class work at the beginning of sinatra
* in class time to work on projects
* start talking about scaling
* ruby the hard way was good, up to a certain point, not all
* great to have both design and scalability
* Do caching a week or do before we did it
* Do homework for today’s class before the lecture or after it.
* Submit a draft and then the real thing
* Could leave out
* In the future maybe turn this into two courses
* Too much homework to keep track of
* Students may not do the homework if theres no grade
* Submit a question or start a discussion about something….
* Dropbox didn’t work perfectly

#### Post it notes feedback in Spring 2015 around lecture 16
* SCALE
  * If the course had more of a fous on things relating to scale and less things * relating to ruby/sinatra
  * give us more info on scaling. more in depth.
  * more talk about scaling
  * get into the implementation of caching, load testing and making services * faster. I would really like to learn how to use Redis
* OK
  * I couldnt say: I think the course is going well
  * overall like that we can follow along with examples on our own machines and * think its very rewarding
  * i'm not sure :(
  * i have learned a lot in this class and cant think of anything that would be * more rewarding
  * To be honest I have gotten the most out of speaking w Nick "post" class or * outside the class. Sessions describing the structure of assignments * explaining technical aspects greatly improved my understanding.
* TIME
  * workshops - getting the app done turned out to be very dificult and we * werent able to finish. While I like learning that way having regular * workshops/labs would be great
  * More office hours
  * built in lab time. Early in this course it could be used for workshops; * later in the course for group access to the TAs. The limiting factor for * figuring out this stuff is time.
* CODING
  * more small coding projects
  * hints for an assingment as an initial push maybe
  * i think maybe more build-up assignments and in class demonstreations before * jumping into nanotwitter. Twitterhack and user-service helped a lot but more * on databases and interacting with data
  * i liked your sinatra persistence example. it was nice to see it gone through * step by step. I think doing this for more concepts, like duck typing for * example, would be nice
  * a few more coding examples relative to the more abstrac theoretical lessons * in the class
* MISC
  * add answers to deliverables afer the submission deadline
  * review how to use sqlite and postgre
  * For me learning these skills to create web applications is already rewarding * enough. I just have to make sure to try helping with both the HTML and * SInatra parts
  * maybe share some more useful tools and more examples of good code style
  * more heroku guidance
  * no written summary turn-in
