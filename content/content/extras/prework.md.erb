title: Recommended Pre-Work
---
For those of you (most of you) who don't have experience with Ruby on Rails, here is a list of preparatory work that you ought to do before coming to the first day of class. There are a lot of things to learn in this course, so I very strongly recommend you to do the following prework before the class starts.

#### Your Computer
<%= callout("Hot Tip", " If you have a windows computer, install a Linux Dual Boot partition. Students have all kinds of computers. I have nothing against Microsoft Windows, and you can take this course using just windows. But you're life is going to be difficult. It just seems that the open source tools and libraries we use don't like Windows. If you have a Windows computer I strongly strongly suggest you ask someone how to install a Linux partition or dual boot.") %>

#### What you can do before the first class

* **PRIORITY 1: Learn Ruby thoroughly.** Ruby is a very cool language with basic and advanced features. We will have a brief time at the start of the course to get into Ruby but it will really pay off if you get ahead on this.

  Depending on how you best learn there are several approaches to take for learning Ruby. You can of course just use google to find resources and tutorails.

  The recommended self-study site is [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). Students have had good success with it. You will be going up to Lesson 45. Do as many as you can ahead of time!

* **PRIORITY 2: Do <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>.** This will both get a major initial homework out of the way but also prove to yourself that you've gotten a good sense of Ruby and how to use it. Here it is: <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>

#### Resources you will use constantly

* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com): You may or may not have heard of Stack Overflow, but have you really used it? Have you looked for answers - probably yes, but have you posted questions? You will be doing both extensively during the course, so you might as well get used to it!
* [Google](http://google.com) Google is your friend. You know this of course. Almost any technical problem you encounter has been solved and written up by someone. Google it. Ask Mother Google. Ask The Google!

##### Other interesting resources
* [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org) Highly readable and concise (yet comprehensive :) guides to the most important parts of Rails. Often better than any book or manual.
* [Rails Casts](http://railscasts.com) This web site contains hundreds of free screen casts that give step by step explanations on all sorts of use cases of rails. As the series has been going on for years, and has been in suspended animation since this June, you will see videos that talk about old versions of Rails and obsolete techniques. So, your mileage may vary but it's still a great resource.
* [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=ruby) - Ruby programming katas.
* [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org) - Another excellent Rails tutorial
