<%= homework_hdr %>

* Read [POODR] Chapters 9 (again). Notice that last class I asked you to read 8 amd 9. Now, just re-read Chapter 9, and take your time. It's important and subtle. The best thing to do is to actually type in the code and get it to work. I bet you will run 2-3x as much as you would just reading it carefully! <%= deliverable "Reply to the NEW warmups in Latte" %>

**Extensions on homeworks from last class (Friday). Please take good advantage of this chance to catch up! Submit these homeworks for lecture 15 if you didn't finish.**

* Finish everything under nT 0.2 (+ 0.1). Do the work in your portfolio, submit it to github. <%= team_deliverable "Also zip together your directory and post it to latte."%>
* Read [Minimalicious testing in Ruby 1.9 with MiniTest](http://blog.arvidandersson.se/2012/03/28/minimalicous-testing-in-ruby-1-9)
* Do the assignment in <%= link_to_topic :hw_tdd %>. Do it in your <%= :portfolio %> under subdirectory `tdd_example`. <%= deliverable "Zip up your directory and submit it to latte." %>
