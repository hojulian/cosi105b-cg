1. **Team**: Finish everything under nT 0.5 and before.  Do the work in your portfolio, submit it to github. <%= team_deliverable "Also zip together your directory and post it to latte."%>**GRADED FOR PARTICIPATION**
1. **Individual team members**: Process your nT through [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/signup) Write a note explaining some parts of your code that got a terrible "grade", what the "smell" was, did you agree with the grade and how you refactored to improve the grade. <%= deliverable "Write up on the code climate work." %>
