1. Study \[POODR\] Chapter 4. This is a difficult chapter. Make sure you have focused time to study it and follow along the coding samples in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %> directory `POODR`<%= deliverable "Locate and submit \\[POODR\\] Chapter 4 Warmup Questions in Latte" %>
1. Complete and submit <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> as usual, in a directory called `movies-2` in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. Look closely at the end of (PA) Movies Part 2 where two deliverables are specified.<%= deliverable "Submit them to Latte." %>

#### Homework Discussion
* Look at some of the questions asked in \[POODR\] work

<%= include_topic :code_smells %>

#### Design Fundamentals
* Aesthetics/Beauty/Sweet Smelling code
* Like a 'beautiful proof' or an 'elegant argument'
* Programming in the small or large can be beautiful
* Not an end to itself:
  * Leads to: higher quality code
  * Leads to: code that is easier to modify/adapt to new requirements
  * Leads to: healthier code that doesn't get sick and decay as quickly

##### Decomposition
* A core **life** skill
* I want to get into grad school: what are the steps? How do I decompose the problem?
* You want to make an argument for something: what are the steps, how do I build a case?
* Outlines, hierarchy, dependencies
* For Software Design, decomposition is the central first step
* **Example:**
  * Class Bicycle might be better represented as Class Bicycle + Class Wheel

##### Abstraction
* Programming is all about abstraction
* Understanding the important aspects of a problem, ignoring the rest
* 'Leaky Abstractions'
* Note, this does not always require inheritence!
* **Example:**
  * Class Invoice includes a collection of products with a price and a description
  * We're abstracting away the difference between each product as long as they respond to messages

##### Information hiding
* "Inside" vs. "Outside", scales at many levels
* "What you don't know can't hurt you"
* Harden against future inevitable change
* **Example:**
  * Make everything possible `private`
  * Example: Does anyone outside of Invoice need to know how the collection is represented?

##### Decoupling
* Related but not the same as decomposition
* **Example:**
  * Can I write Class Wheel so it knows nothing at all about class Bicycle?

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
