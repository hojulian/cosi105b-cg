During the first three weeks of class there will be three progressively more difficult programming assignments. You will have the whole week to work on them. Each assignment is due one week after it is presented to you.

The assignments will focus only on Ruby, not Rails or Sinatra The objective is to solidify your ruby programming and debugging abilities.
