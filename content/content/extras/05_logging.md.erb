<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>  **Trip Advisor**: Experiment with Trip Advisor. Look at the Hotels page for a large city: New York, Paris, London, Tokyo. Enter some dates for a hotel stay and see the prices come up for dozens of hotels. Think about what is behind that.
    One fact to start with, that makes it even more complicated,  is - TripAdvisor is not a travel agency. It does not manage the prices or availability for these hotels, or make the bookings - that is handled by the online travel agencies like Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity. <%= deliverable "Do some googling and take some guesses about what Trip Advisor's architecture is to handle the prices and availability for hotels" %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= codebadge %> **Complete nt 0.7 as a team:** See: <%= link_to_topic :nt_outline %> for detailed submission instructions and specifics for this stage. <%= team_deliverable %(Github repo zipped up.) %>
