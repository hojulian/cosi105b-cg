1. <%= partbadge %> <%= codebadge %> **Complete nt 0.8 as a team:** See: <%= link_to_topic :nt_outline %> for detailed submission instructions and specifics for this stage. <%= team_deliverable %(Github repo zipped up.) %>


#### Review
* Let's take a look at the <%= link_to_topic :cs105b_final_deliverables %>
* Let's take a look at <%= link_to_topic :scalability_runoff %>
* Quick review of <%= link_to_topic :nt_client_library %>
* Discussion about using Heroku for a service

#### Things I look for in a "Software Enginer"

* Excellent grasp of Computer Science fundamentals (roughly equivalent to our core Cosi B.S. requirements)
* Excellent grasp of their chosen programming language
* Talent at design, architecture, coding, testing
* Prioritizes longevity, maintainability, reusability, sharing (repositories, version management)
* Follows throough on quality, fit and finish, and testing of all kinds at all levels
* Understands the eternal tradeoff: cost, features, time, quality
* Reliable, transparent, willing to make commitments, able to meet them
