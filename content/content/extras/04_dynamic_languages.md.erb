<%= homework_hdr %>
1. **POODR**: Study \[POODR\] Chapter 5. <%= deliverable "Please complete the warmups in Latte"%>
2. **nanoTwitter teams**: I won't micromanage this, but continue working on nanoTwitter. nT 0.3 Will have to be complete next class.
3. **Duck Typing**: Do <%= link_to_topic :duck_typing_ex %>. <%= deliverable "Submit code in a single.rb file to Latte" %>

#### Discussion
* Article Discussion
  * Read this [Twitter cuts Meercat from its social graph just as SXSW gets started](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/13/8213255/twitter-cuts-meerkat-off-from-its-social-graph-just-as-sxsw-gets)
  * How did Twitter do that? What is the impact of that change? Why did Twitter do that? Do you agree with what they did?
  * 5 minutes: Read and think on your own about the answers to those questions
  * 5 minutes: disucss with your neighbor

#### Static vs. Dynamic Typing
* Look at and examine the sequence of examples from Chapter 5

* Static vs. Dynamic Typing
  * Java interfaces are like Classes without method bodies
  * You can only call a method on the right type
  * There is enough information in the text of the program
  * Compile can catch errors and compiled code can be optimized for performance

~~~~ java
interface Animal {

   public void eat();
   public void travel();
}
Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
myAnimal.eat();
~~~~

#### Dynamic Typing
* Objects determine at run time whether they implement a message (method)
* Nothing in the syntax of the code limits what is possible at run time
* Compilation and exection are more tightly connected
* Opens up new and rich design options (Duck typing, meta programming)

<%= include_topic :duck_typing %>

##### Inferred typing
* A new concept
* Somewhere between the two
* Some newer languages, e.g. TypeScript: [Type Inference](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Type%20Inference.md)
