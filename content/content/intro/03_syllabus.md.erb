#### Course Description

How do you design a system that is meant to support millions of users? How will it perform? You certainly can’t just get a bigger and bigger computer. In this course we look at how to design and architect large scale web based systems. What are the classic algorithms and patterns used to achieve massive scale?

This is most certainly an evolving space with new work happening both in academia and industry. Yet there are well established and tested fundamentals of architecture which we will look at to better understand this fascinating and important space. We will look at caching, database partitioning, queueing, messaging and more. And we apply this learning working in teams of students to design and implement their own version of the Twitter backend from the ground up, and then stress test and measure it’s scalability using real world tools and technologies.

#### Course Themes
1. Architecture for Scale: We also want to examine how to design systems which will scale under major load, whether it be many users, many transactions, lots of data, etc. Each of these are different kinds of scale challenges and will require different kinds of strategies. We will also of course look at generating synthetic load and measuring scale correctly.
1. Software Design: We want to look at programming beyond just 'getting it to work.' In large systems one thinks a lot about what happens to the program once its written. Software that's used in the real world will always get revised, often. We will look at foundational principles of design such as the Single Responsibility Principle, Inheritance vs. Delegation tradeoffs, the importance of good naming, Test driven design, and many others.
d1. Major development project: There will be multiple programming assignments where students will work individually or in teams to modify and enhance parts of the NanoTwitter software. Students will have to build and test on their own computers and then deploy software to servers in the cloud. We will subject the software to artificial loads to see how they behave and then see how changes affect performance.

#### Additional Information

##### Pre-requisites or permission
Cosi21a and permission of the instructor are required for admission to this course. Permission is not required if you have taken Cosi166b. The reason for the prerequisite is that we jump very quickly into using a new language (Ruby) and framework (Sinatra.) If you are a good programmer and feel comfortable learning Ruby and Sinatra on your own, then I will be glad to give you permission. Please send me an email at pitosalas@brandeis.edu with your questions.

##### Pre-work
Students have all kinds of computers. I have nothing against Microsoft Windows, and you could take this course using just windows, but you're life (and ours) is just going to be more difficult. It just seems that the open source tools and libraries we use don't like Windows. So for this course, if your computer is set up with just windows, you are **required** to set up a Linux parition. It's not hard. Here are the details: <%= link_to_topic :linux_partition %>
