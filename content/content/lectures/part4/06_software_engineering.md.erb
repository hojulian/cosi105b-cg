#### Things I look for in a "Software Enginer"

* Excellent grasp of Computer Science fundamentals (roughly equivalent to our core Cosi B.S. requirements)
* Excellent grasp of their chosen programming language
* Talent at design, architecture, coding, testing
* Prioritizes longevity, maintainability, reusability, sharing (repositories, version management)
* Follows throough on quality, fit and finish, and testing of all kinds at all levels
* Understands the eternal tradeoff: cost, features, time, quality
* Reliable, transparent, willing to make commitments, able to meet them
