Make sure you follow the link and also read: [One to Many](http://www.tekstenuitleg.net/en/articles/software/database-design-tutorial/one-to-many.html) and [Many to Many](http://www.tekstenuitleg.net/en/articles/software/database-design-tutorial/many-to-many.html). Once you've read that, please answer the following warmup questions (by 10am on class day!)

    * Give an example that is not mentioned in the reading of a one to many relationship. Why is it one to many?
    *  Explain what a foreign key is and how it is used, exactly, to do a one to many relationship.
    * In what way is a relational database similar or reminiscent of a spreadsheet?
    * Please list two concepts from the reading that you don't understand, and if you feel you understand it well, then the two most important ideas of this reading.
