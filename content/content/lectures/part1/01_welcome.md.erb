<%= callout("Note for first day of class:", " Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually 'pre-work' for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.") %>

1. **Linux Parition**: Over the years, developing Ruby and Sinatra on Windows has been a less than pleasant experience, in fact a massive headache. You should seriously consider setting up Here is why and how: <%= link_to_topic :linux_partition %>. Another option is to use VMWare.

1. **Ruby Install**: Install Ruby 2.5. Here are my Ruby installation instructions: <%= link_to_topic :ruby_install_tips %>

1. **Ruby**: Review your Ruby knowledge by going through [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). You should be at least up to Lesson 23. This will cover many of the basics up to functions. There is nothing to hand in here. But it's crucial that you really do the lessons and try the hands on work. No reading on your phone while on the treadmill! You shoring up the foundations on which your success in this course will be built!
