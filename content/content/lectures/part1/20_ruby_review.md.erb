1. <%= partbadge %> <%= zipbadge %> **Programming:** Begin <%= link_to_topic :pa_interactive_music %>. This assignment is designed to have you practice and demonstrate your ruby programming skills. It has no complicated algorithms, but you will have to know how to design a program, design a few classes, use a gem, process user input. <%= deliverable "First draft of solution, zip up the directory and submit to Latte." %>

#### Ruby Live Coding Demonstration
* <%= link_to_topic :intro_tut %>
* <%= link_to_topic :classes_tut %>
* <%= link_to_topic :inheritance_tut %>

#### Ruby
* Questions about the homework.
* Ruby coding reminders:
  * spaces not tabs, 2 spaces per tab
  * Classes are CamelCased
  * method_names and variable_names are lower case, with underlines
  * filenames are lower case with underlines, named after the top_level_class.rb
  * Classes should be less than 100 lines long
  * Methods should be less than 15 lines long
  * No standalone code or definitions. Everything should be part of a class
  * No global variables
  * Instance variables are always private
  * Don't use @@foo
  * instead of a method called "display" on a class, add a method called to_s which returns the class state as a text string. That way you can do a puts on it.

#### Live coding
  * Lets do this program: <%= link_to_topic :pa_code_classes_2 %>

#### Discussions and questions
  * Review <%= link_to_topic :pa_interactive_music %>
  * MOSS
  * Everyone takes 5 minutes to write down 2 ruby questions on paper
  * Round Robin questions from beginning
