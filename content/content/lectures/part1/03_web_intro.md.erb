<%= callout("Note", " This lecture is significantly modified from before. The homework submission here is for the final results of the interactive music homework assigment. The Sinatra homework that was here has been moved forward a little but it's still coming!") %>

1. <%= codebadge %> **Programming:** Submit your final <%= link_to_topic :pa_interactive_music %>. This assignment is designed to have you practice and demonstrate your ruby programming skills. It has no complicated algorithms, but you will have to know how to design a program, design a few classes, use a gem, process user input, and write some tests.

#### Code review
* I will look for a couple of volunteers so we can look at the solution that they have submitted. See [Art Crits](http://q-art.org.uk/portfolio/art-crits-20-questions/)

  > "The crit is a model of learning whereby artists present their work to a group in order to gain feedback on how that work is being ‘read’ and ways that they might develop it further. They are a part of almost every art course at further and higher level education throughout the UK."
