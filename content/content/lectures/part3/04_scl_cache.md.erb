1. <%=partbadge %> <%= codebadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> Complete nt 0.4 as a team (See: <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>). Write and submit a brief project update as a pdf. What went well, what were the challenges, and what are the remaining problems. <%= team_deliverable %(nT code for **nanoTwitter 0.4** in portfolio and github. Submit to Latte the brief project update.) %>

#### nT 0.4
* 5 minute team discussion about your status
* Write on a piece of paper what % of nT 0.0-nt 0.4 you have completed
* Reference: <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>

#### Review: Achieving Scale
* Measuring performance:
  * How many Xs per second?
  * and/orhow long does it take to Y?
* Analysis
  * Instrumentation (basically logging)
  * Deep thought
  * Identify the bottle neck
* Action
  * Remove the bottle neck
* Remember: One of the cardinal "sins" is optimizing early
  * Instead, optimize based on measurement
  * Discover which parts of your product's features is causing a scaling problem
  * Consider which of your techniques might be brought to bear
