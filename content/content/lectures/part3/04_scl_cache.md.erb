#### Discussion
* Decide on Tech Pres schedule

#### Review: Achieving Scale
* Measuring performance:
  * How many Xs per second?
  * and/orhow long does it take to Y?
* Analysis
  * Instrumentation (basically logging)
  * Deep thought
  * Identify the bottle neck
* Action
  * Remove the bottleneck
* Remember: One of the cardinal "sins" is optimizing early
  * Instead, optimize based on measurement
  * Discover which parts of your product's features is causing a scaling problem
  * Consider which of your techniques might be brought to bear
