  * a username (aka Twitter handle) your name on twitter
  * to "mention":when you write @pitosalas in a tweet;
  * to followi: when you ask to see tweets from someone else;
  * \[n,v\] "tweet" or "post" or "update": the 140 character message you can send with twitter.
  * a twitter stream or feed: all the tweets that a certain user has posted
  * a #hashtag: a way to tag any tweet, which can be searched later
  * a timeline: a real time stream of tweets. Your home stream or timeline is where you see all the tweets shared by the people you follow
